        <h2>The Usual Boring Stuff</h2>
        <p>
          As of June 18, 2019, I am 12 years old.  What probably takes up the most time in my life is piano.  I study this instrument at Juilliard Pre-College.  I have been learning piano for seven years now: since I turned five.  I have played with two orchestras; however, neither of them have videos I can provide yet.  Though I have no videos for those two, I have other videos that I will show you.  I currently homeschool.  When I am not doing piano nor acedemic work, I enjoy playing and making Role-Player Games (RPGs).

          Here is a video of me playing for a Christmas Performance.  I am playing Tchaikovsky's Waltz of the Flowers (piano) , from the Nutcracker, arranged for piano trio.

          <h3>Piano Competitions</h3>
          <p>
            To many young pianists competitions are everything.  Before one becomes famous and has steady appearances at a concert hall, their greatest venue is in competitions.  <a href="http://en.chopin.nifc.pl/institute/chopincompetition/info">The Chopin Competition</a>, in Poland, and the <a href="https://www.cliburn.org/">Van Cliburn Competition</a>, in Texas, are two of the most famous piano competitions for budding pianists.
          </p>
            <div class="superTinyContainer">
              <h4>The Waring International Piano Competition in Palm Desert, CA</h4>
              <p>This competition was the very best competition I have ever been to.  With a wonderful location, kind staff, and large prizes, it was amazing.  I was awarded second prize.

                I am classifying my pieces into different categories, each of which will be indicated by a color.  Etudes, or more technical pieces, will be in red; emotional pieces will be in purple, modern pieces will be in blue, and other pieces will be in green.</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="etude">Chopin-Etude in C-sharp minor, Op.10, No. 4</li>
                <li class="other">Bach- Italian Concerto in F Major, BWV 971 (1st Mvt.)</li>
                <li class="other">Debussy- Prelude Book I, No. 11 'La Danse de Puck'</li>
                <li class="modern">Robert Muczynski- Six Preludes, Op. 6, Nos. 1, 3 & 4</li>
                <li class="emotional">Chopin- Waltz in A minor, Op. 64 No. 2</li>
                <li class="emotional">Beethoven- Sonata in C minor, Op.13 'Path√©tique'</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Here is the video of me playing in the finals round.  I only played the Debussy in the first round, so it is not here.  If you want to see it, look up my name in YouTube and it will show up.</p>
